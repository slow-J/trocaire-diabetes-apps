# Trocaire Diabetes Management App Collection
The goal of this project is to provide the tools to enable patients with diabetes to communicate their blood sugar level and blood pressure test results. These tests results data must also be visualised for the doctors so that they can track the health and wellbeing of their patients and take actions if necessary.

## Client Requirements
* The solutions must run on an Android device.
* Assume that patients may have a low level of literacy.
* Assume that patients will have access to a local health worker who are literate.

## Solution
### Patient Android App

### Doctor Android App

### Administrative Dashboard Web App
This dashboard should serve both administrators and doctors.
